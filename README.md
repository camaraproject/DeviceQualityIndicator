# DeviceQualityIndicator

Repository to describe, develop, document, and test the DeviceQualityIndicator API within the Sub Project [DeviceStatus]([https://wiki.camaraproject.org/display/CAM/Sub+Projects](https://wiki.camaraproject.org/x/-QAG)) of CAMARA

* API Repository [wiki page](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/GQCbBQ)

## Scope

* Service API “DeviceQualityIndicator” (see [APIBacklog.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/APIBacklog/blob/main/documentation/APIbacklog.md))
* The API provides the customer with the ability to:  
  * Get insights about the network status of a defined mobile device.
  * For this the API will return an indicator which is bundeling information about the device network status such as availibilty, open datavolume, congjestion, historical congjestion or the connecitvity status (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G).
  * This API would be useful for applications that optimize user experience based on the connecitvity status of a defined device.
* Describe, develop, document, and test the APIs
* Started: August 2024
